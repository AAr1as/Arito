# Contributing Guidelines
This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process.

**This project is actively looking for contributors!**

Because it is built purely in HTML, CSS & JavaScript! and No frameworks or libraries have been used, it's **Beginners-Friendly**  too.

I'm happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to add new scripts to this repository. 
Thank you for helping out and remember, no contribution is too small.

## Steps to Contribute
Following are the steps to guide you:

**Step 2:** Add a upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/prakhartiwari0/arito
```

**Step 3:** Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
```

```

**Step 4:** Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step, so don't skip it)
```
git checkout -b <feature-name>
```

**Step 5:** Commit all the changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
```
git commit -m "Write a meaningfull but small commit message"
```

**Step 6:** Push the changes for review
```
git push origin <branch-name>

**Step 7:** Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing)
